# Color Flood: From Jackson Pollock to Yves Klein

### Background and Overview

Color Flood is an interactive, grid-based, strategy coloring game. A mouthful I'm sure, but the user's objective is to convert the entire grid to a single color by clicking tiles at the bottom and "flooding" the map from the top left tile. The fewer turns the better!
